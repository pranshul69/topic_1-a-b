              <p class="card-text">To illustrate what we mean by a "smart building," let's use the example of Schiphol, a self-sufficient airport in the Netherlands. Without a human attendant present, the entire system uses A.I., and M.L. passengers must arrive 16 minutes before takeoff. Integrators of security systems offer technical advice to the airport, offer and instal solutions, and perform upkeep and repairs. Intelligent cameras to count and monitor crowds. weather prediction software. System for integrated transaction management. Based on time, HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning). These are some of the key roles that A.I. and M.L. IOT-application play in controlling the airport.</p>
